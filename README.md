# Time_Series_Forecasting_Weather_Forecast

This repository is used for implementing weather forecasting using the principles of Time Series Forecasting.

The dataset used is the daily temperature of Helsinki, Finland between the period of 2016 to 2019.

We have used the SARIMA model for the weather forecasting. SARIMA is an acronym for Seasonal ARIMA where ARIMA is Auto Regresssive Integrated Moving Average.

Mean Squared Error is used as the evaluation metric.
